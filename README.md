# Reviewer Allocation

This script is for random allocation of reviewers to applications, allowing for conflicts of interest

Written in VS Code with python 2026.0.0

File 20260212_Applicants_v2.csv is a representative file of the applications with identified reviewer conflicts
File 20260212_reviewers_v2.csv is a representative file of the reviewer IDs

Printed statements appear in the script periodically to allow troubleshooting. The outpout file will show the allocated reviewers for each application, and there will be a printed script in the terminal showing the number of applications alloctaed to each reviewer.
